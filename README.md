Hello! My name is Victoria. I study in the second year at the Belarusian State University at the Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technologies. My specialty: Applied Informatics.
I don't like to sit around. I constantly improve my skills and learn something new. That's why I decided to study programming, for me it is not just brainwork, but also creativity and an interesting hobby.
